	<h1>Topic for our web application</h1> 

<p>The inspiration is HKR students and they are the targeted audience for the applicationâ€™s usage.

We want to offer a web application for second-hand commodity trading, allowing students to buy and/or sell second-hand products.

Our topic of application is a simple second-hand product display website to allow the users to do second-hand purchases. 

It is both student and environmentally friendly.

Our website will mimic something similar to a forum website.<p>

 

<h1>Your choice of techniques</h1>

<p>For the webpage we will be using HTML and CSS for the design.

The backend work will contain techniques of  PHP.


Our database of choice will be MySQL.</p>
